 # Product Sense

### Problem:
New tenants in Nigeria often rent apartments that turn out to have hidden issues (e.g., plumbing, power, water, pest control), with landlords or agents often ignoring complaints once rent is paid.

### User Pain Points:

Lack of transparency about the real condition of a property.
No reliable way to verify claims made by landlords/agents.
Powerlessness when issues arise after moving in.
Fear of speaking out due to landlord-tenant power dynamics.
Opportunity:
Tenants would benefit from a community-driven review platform — similar to how people review hotels (TripAdvisor) or service providers (Google Reviews). A system where past tenants share honest feedback can help new renters make informed decisions and pressure landlords to be more accountable.

## Product Vision

To empower tenants in Nigeria with reliable, crowd-sourced information about housing conditions, landlord responsiveness, and agent transparency — before they rent.
This product aims to shift power back to the tenant, encourage better housing standards, and build trust through shared experiences.
