# SaultLink Product Sense

### What’s the Real Problem?
“The closer you are to the soil, the poorer you are.”

This saying reflects a core injustice in the Nigerian agricultural system:

Farmers do the most essential work—yet earn the least.

They’re disconnected from markets and dependent on middlemen who dictate prices.

Consumers, on the other hand, overpay for food that isn’t even fresh.

### The fundamental issue:

There is a broken link between production (farmers) and demand (buyers).

### Who Are We Building For?
Group	Pain Points	Goals
Farmers	Low income, no market access, no price control, wasted stock	Sell directly at fair price
Bulk Buyers (butchers, retailers, caterers)	Inconsistent quality, inflated prices, delivery issues	Reliable supply, better margins
End Consumers	High prices, poor quality, unhealthy food	Affordable, fresh, traceable food

These users are underserved and would gladly switch to a better, more reliable system.

### Why Now? (Timing Insight)
Rising food inflation in Nigeria makes direct sourcing more appealing.

Mobile phone access is widespread—even in rural areas.

Young farmers are tech-aware and eager for better systems.

The government and donors are actively funding agritech innovations.

### The Product Opportunity
SaultLink’s unique opportunity is to bridge trust, price, and logistics through a simple digital platform that works with or without smartphones.

Rather than building a complex app upfront, SaultLink will:

Start as a mobile-first order coordination system

Use WhatsApp/USSD to list stock and connect buyers

Use local transporters to move food

Collect payment digitally or via escrow systems

Think of it as “Jumia + Opay + Google Forms” for farmers — starting simple, but growing into a full B2B/B2C agri-commerce platform.

### Product Design Principles (How We Build)
**Farmer-First**: Build for low-literate, low-tech users. Simple language. Local languages. Visuals.

**Trust-Driven**: Verified profiles, escrow payments, delivery tracking.

**Flexible Logistics**: Adapt to local realities (bike, cart, truck). Work with what already exists.

**Modular Growth**: Start small. Add features (like pricing intelligence, cold storage) only when needed.

## What Will Success Look Like?
**For farmers**:

A cow sells at ₦450,000 instead of ₦280,000 through a middleman.

Income becomes predictable; planning becomes possible.

**For buyers**:

Cheaper, fresher, and more reliable supply.

Better profit margins or quality meals.

**For Nigeria**:

Stronger rural economies, fewer post-harvest losses, and more stable food prices.

SaultLink exists because millions of hardworking farmers are poor—not because they don’t produce, but because they’re cut off from wealth creation.
This product restores the balance by building direct, fair, and tech-enabled bridges between the soil and the table.
